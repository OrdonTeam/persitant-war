# It is gonna be a game.

## It is gonna be a persistent state universe.

## Rules:

### Economy:

- Game should be as interactive as possible.
- Because of that it will not be possible to improve your economy.
- Each world will produce same amount of goods in same period of time.
- However it is not said that these amount and time will not change.

### Military:

- All units, in all games, can be always divided into two groups - offensive and defensive.
- Superior units can and will be represented as a number of basic ones.
- There is no reason why costs of offensive and defensive troops should differ.
- Defensive units are unable to attack.
- Defensive units on the other hand are stronger than offensive.
- I would propose single defensive unit twice stronger than offensive.

### Massiveness:
 
- Universe will not be limited to any number of players.
- Game rules and dynamic should favor newcomers.
- Game rules and dynamic should favor cooperativeness.
- Game rules and dynamic should prevent automation from easy domination. 
- To limit automation concept of credits will be introduced.
- Credits will accumulate over time, but will not exceed some limit.
- Credits will be require to perform most (or even all) actions in game.

### Battle:

- Battle have to be announced in advance.
- It will be achieved by some concept of distance.
- All worlds will have its locations.
- Distance does not have to be constant during the game.
- Distance does not have to follow any rules of geometry.
- Battle result should be predictable.
- Army in movement can not be attacked.
- Because all movements will be public it have to be possible to change army target.
